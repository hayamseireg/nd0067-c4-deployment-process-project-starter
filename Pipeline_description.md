A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that help to streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications. Here are the main steps involved in a typical CI/CD pipeline:

Code Repository: Developers commit their code changes to a version control system such as Git. The code repository serves as the source of truth for the application's code.

Continuous Integration (CI): Once the code is committed, the CI process automatically builds the application, runs tests, and performs code analysis to ensure that the code is of high quality and can be merged into the main branch of the code repository. The CI process should be automated and run every time a developer commits code changes.

Build: Once the CI process is successful, the pipeline proceeds to the build phase. The build process compiles the application code, packages it, and creates a build artifact that is ready for deployment.

Testing: Once the build artifact is deployed, the application undergoes various types of tests to ensure that it is working correctly. These tests may include unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and performance tests.

Approval: After the application passes all the tests, it is ready for production deployment. However, we are requiring a manual approval before the deployment can proceed.

Continuous Delivery (CD): The CD process automatically deploys the build artifact to an environment where it can be tested and validated. This environment can be a staging environment or a production environment, depending on the organization's deployment strategy.

Deployment: Once the application is approved, it is deployed to the production environment. The deployment process should be automated and repeatable to ensure that the application is deployed consistently and reliably.
